1. 📊 What Data We Collect
Mishi only processes minimal, non-sensitive data in real time, strictly for operational purposes. We temporarily handle the following:

Message content — used to process prefix commands like +play, +skip, +pause, etc.

Voice state events — such as joining or leaving a voice channel.

User IDs — to execute commands, identify users for song requests, and apply DJ permissions.

❌ We do not collect or store:
Usernames, emails, or direct/private messages

IP addresses or device information

Any sensitive personal data

Any data unrelated to the bot’s features

2. ⚙️ How We Use the Data
The limited data Mishi processes is used exclusively to:

Respond to music-related commands (e.g., +play, +queue)

Join, leave, and control activity in voice channels

Track voice activity to determine when to stop playback (e.g., when everyone leaves)

3. ⏱️ Data Retention
Mishi does not store any user data persistently.

All data is processed in-memory and discarded immediately after the command/session completes.

No logs or databases are used to retain personal information.

4. 🔐 Who Has Access
Only the authorized Mishi bot developer has access to the bot’s runtime environment.

No user data is ever shared, sold, analyzed, or exposed to third parties.

5. 🧾 Your Rights & Control
Since Mishi does not store personal data:

There is no information to request deletion of.

You can stop using Mishi at any time by removing it from your Discord server or revoking its permissions.
